# Medical-Diagnosis-using-ML
A Machine Learning-based web application that predicts the risk of multiple diseases using medical parameters. The system helps in early health risk screening and supports better decision-making.

# Overview

Smart Health Predictor is a multi-disease prediction system built using classical Machine Learning algorithms and deployed with a simple Streamlit interface.
It analyzes user-input health data and provides instant risk predictions.
This system is designed as a decision-support tool and does not replace professional medical diagnosis.

# Diseases Supported
* Diabetes
* Heart Disease
* Hypothyroidism
* Parkinson’s Disease
* Lung Cancer Risk

# Features
* Multi-disease prediction in a single platform
* Fast and real-time results
* User-friendly Streamlit interface
* High accuracy using trained ML models
* Secure – no user data storage

# Technologies Used
* Python
* Scikit-learn
* Pandas & NumPy
* Streamlit
* Machine Learning Algorithms:
  * K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  * Naïve Bayes
  * XGBoost

# Methodology
1. Collected medical datasets from trusted sources (UCI, Kaggle)
2. Data preprocessing and feature scaling
3. Train-test split (80/20)
4. Model training and evaluation
5. Best model selected for each disease
6. Deployment using Streamlit

# Results
The system achieved good performance across diseases, with accuracy ranging from 75% to 98% depending on the dataset and model.

# Future Improvements
* Integration with wearable health devices
* Mobile application support
* Addition of more diseases
* Cloud deployment
